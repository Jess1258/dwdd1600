            <h2>Definitions on Child Syndrome</h2>
               <h3>What is...?</h3>
                          
            <p>Oldest child syndrome refers to a number of characteristics people develop as an outcome of being the first-born. For instance, following the birth of another baby, the firstborn goes from being the “only child” of their parents to having to share their parent’s love and attention with a younger sibling. This leads to a lot of stress and competitiveness, which may seem normal for a while, but over time can become toxic and a set of <a href="Insider.html#Disadvantages">Disadvantages for being the Oldest</a> start to overwhem firstborns.</p>

                        <dd>"Middle-child syndrome" is the idea that if you're neither the oldest child nor the youngest, you get less attention from your parents and feel “caught in the middle”</dd></dl>

            <h2>What Parents notice in their oldest child</h2>
            <p> Being the oldest child in a family has its perks, and also its decided disadvantages. That child is the “lab rat”-of-the-pack, upon which the parents have to test all of their scientific, experimental or experiential theories. Baby will have a natural, vaginal birth! Cloth diapers! A perfect nursery! Hundreds of photos posted on the baby’s own blog! Center-of-the-Universe privileges! All is happy, that is, until the second child enters the scene. The former “only child” becomes the “oldest child.” He or she feels devastated. Who is this raucous bundle taking Mommy’s and Daddy’s love and attention? Being the oldest now means the two will be in competition.<a href=https://www.everydayhealth.com/kids-health/helping-your-first-overcome-oldest-child-syndrome/#:~:textGuiding%20Your%20EldestProvide%20opportunities,to%20his%20age%20or%20capabilities. target="_blank"> Helping Your First Overcome The Oldest-Child Syndrome</a></p>
