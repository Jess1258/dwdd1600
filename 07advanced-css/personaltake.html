          <p>Here is my own personal take on what I feel like OSS is to me. This page goes over why and how OSS has affected my life. The characteristics of OSS are the basis for who I am and why I created a website so anyone who was seeking knowledge on the topic could have a better understanding to the <strong>Oldest Sibling</strong></p>

          <h2>My take on being the Oldest Sibling</h2>
          <br>
          <p>As an older sibling in a home of six, the amount of patience I carry is very large. I raised my siblings through all their different developmental stages and counseled them through all their grief. When I think of the phrase “Oldest Sibling” I always relate it back to the secondary caretaker. I don’t believe that younger siblings appreciate the turmoil that we go through day to day. As an older sibling, I have given up a lot of my freedom and happiness to make sure my siblings end up with a positive perception of life and grow to be their best selves.</p>
        <p>The connections I have with my siblings that I have to this day are the reason I am who I am today. I am a very selfless human being because of how I was raised and how I chose to raise my siblings. I always stepped up when those around me needed me the most. </p>
        <p>It can be very exhausting keeping up with the expectation of life and the ideals of being perfect in a world that does not tend to recognise the guinea pig siblings' problems. It is hard to deal with the idea that your childhood will never be as joyful and comforting as the children one helped raise and positively impacted.</p>
        <p>In the end, though It is all worth it to see what you have done to see a smile on the faces of people you love.</p>
