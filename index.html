        <h2>History</h2>
               <h3>Where did we start?</h3>
                          
         <p>“Our first office was so tiny that if you took a step backwards, you fell down an open hole that was stairs to the basement. Now we are a worldwide company with offices in the United States, Brasil, Australia” – Jason B. Summer, CEO of Budget Vacations.</p>

                        <dt><strong>São Paulo</strong></dt>

                        <dd>Recife is the city of seas, rivers, bridges, islands, and mangroves.

                        <dd>Sprawling across the Brazilian savanna, 600 miles inland from the coast, Brasília confounds every person who visits the city. Inaugurated in 1960 and replacing Rio de Janeiro as Brazil's national capital, the street and building plan of Brasília has been said to resemble a bird or an airplane or a bow-and-arrow.</dd>
